## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

Our team, in collaboration with Kevin Lee from Penny, is creating a cross-mobile application that can be utilized to price-check products amongst a user's local grocery stores. The drastic rise in inflation and overall cost of living has been causing financial strain on everyone. Worrying about affording basic needs such as food should not be an issue people have to deal with. 

With this issue in mind, we are determined to tackle the need for locating cheaper grocery products, and grocery stores as a whole. Our team aims to alleviate the stress of grocery shopping on a tight financial and location-based budget, as well as make grocery shopping a seamless experience. This app will have a plethora of products from the user's closest grocery stores, allowing the user to be able to see the locations of the cheapest products, and how far away the grocery store holding them lies. The app would especially be useful for university students operating on a tight budget, and elderly individuals with health complications limiting their travel who are looking for the closest cheap grocery store.

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Specify if you have a partner and who they are.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app, browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the partner or the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our price-checking app is flexible enough to be used by anyone. However, the user groups who we are primarily focusing on are students and the elderly. To be more specific, university students between their second and fourth year living off campus, and elderly individuals who live on their own and not in a retirement or old-age home or facility. These groups of people are most likely to use our app because of their circumstances. 

University students, particularly those in their second to fourth year living off campus, face the challenge of budgeting for groceries without having the convenience of on-campus dining options such as meal halls and cafes. We intend on catering our application to this group of individuals because of such circumstances, university students living off campus needing to grocery shop at cheaper places because of their modest budgets and interests. 

The second group of users we are targeting are the elderly, particularly elderly people not living in retirement or old-age facilities. These individuals are most likely living on their own, and are required to get their own groceries. The elderly are retired and often weaker and inhibitied by underlying health conditions and symptoms of old age. This limits them from being able to freely travel around to different grocery stores, regardless of whether a certain store has cheaper products. Therefore, this app will be used by this user group in the hopes of locating the closest cheapest grocery product. Elderly people living on their own and budgeting their retirement funds will be able to use our location feature on the app to find the closest products, and closest, on-average-cheapest grocery stores.

 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

As stated earlier, our main goal is to alleviate the stress of grocery shopping on a financial and location-based budget. Our targeted user groups of off-campus second to fourth year university students, and elderly people living on their own with fixed incomes and limited mobility use are mainly impacted by this stress and the impact of the rising costs of living. With an easy-to-use interface that shows the costs of grocery products in the user's surrounding grocery locations, our users would choose this app to help with their grocery shopping. 

Our app saves our users time of manually having to check their surrounding grocery stores to compare prices of products. Instead all users have to do is search a product on our application, and they will be presented all the different prices of this product, as well as the distance these grocery stores are from the user. This information presented to them will always be up to date with the grocery stores' prices and stock. These benefits will be a huge incentive for our targeted user groups to utilize our app, as it saves time and makes their grocery shopping process more convenient. 

This app may exist in some shape or form, however, it is not widely known nor accessible to our targeted user groups. Our app will be easily accessible, and always updated with the latest data and information. Our app will align with Kevin's values and goals of helping people operate in a smarter, easier, and less stressful way.

 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how and how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools to be used or being considered. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
## Technology Stack

**Frontend:** Dart, along with the Flutter framework, will be pivotal for creating a cross-platform app thatâ€™s compatible with both iOS, Android, and a cross-browser web application.

**Backend:** Python is chosen for web scraping due to its efficiency and the availability of libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or Selenium for easy and effective data extraction.

**Database:** PostgreSQL is the chosen database for storing the scraped data, given its robustness, reliability, and support for JSON data types which could be helpful for storing varied data structures that are scraped.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using a combination of traditional web hosts, cloud services, or even serverless computing. For our project, we will continue the deployment with Supabase, an open source Firebase alternative. It provides support for the required runtime environments and databases.

## Architecture

1. **Web Scraping Module:** We will utilize Python scripts to scrape data, which are scheduled to run at regular intervals to update the database.
2. **Database:** We will use PostgreSQL to store scraped data, ensuring it is structured and easily accessible.
3. **Backend Logic:** We will implement APIs (possibly using a framework like Flask or FastAPI) to interface between the database and the frontend application.
4. **Frontend Application:** We will use Dart with Flutter to build the UI, making API calls to fetch, display, and interact with the data.

Here, the Python scripts ensure that the database is always up to date. Dart (Flutter) plays a crucial role in accessing and displaying this data to the end-users in a user-friendly manner.

## Third Party Applications or APIs

Given the nature of the application, the Google Maps API might be essential for calculating distances and offering map views for various grocery stores.

Do a team-building activity in-person or online. This can be playing an online game, meeting for bubble tea, lunch, or any other activity you all enjoy.
* Get to know each other on a more personal level.
* Provide a few sentences on what you did and share a picture or other evidence of your team building activity.
* Share at least three fun facts from members of you team (total not 3 for each member).




#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. One person may have multiple roles.  
 * Add role(s) to your Team-[Team_Number]-[Team_Name].csv file on the main folder.
 * At least one person must be identified as the dedicated partner liaison. They need to have great organization and communication skills.
 * Everyone must contribute to code. Students who don't contribute to code enough will receive a lower mark at the end of the term.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * Why did you choose them to take that role? Specify if they are interested in learning that part, experienced in it, or any other reasons. Do no make things up. This part is not graded but may be reviewed later.


#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
 * You should have 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
   * You must keep track of meeting minutes and add them to your repo under "deliverables/minutes" folder
   * You must have a regular meeting schedule established for the rest of the term.  
  
#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

Our main source of communication will be scheduled weekly in-person meetings or online meetings through Zoom. There will be another meeting with our partner and another with our TA to address any questions and ensure we are on the right track.

After each meeting, we will discuss everyoneâ€™s tasks for the week and what needs to be completed before the next meeting. This information will be updated on Notion, which will serve as our task board. If anyone encounters any difficulties, we have a group chat available for communication outside of our scheduled meetings.

The group will prioritize tasks based on how we can ensure everyone works as efficiently as possible. If a particular task must be completed before other group members can proceed, we will give it priority.

During our group meetings, tasks will be assigned based on each member's skillset. Additionally, we will take into consideration the availability of the members and their workload. If a group member wishes to learn a new skill or work on a different aspect of the project, we can discuss it during our group meetings.

The status of work from inception to completion will be determined collectively by everyone working on that aspect of the project, with input from all other members. We aim for unanimous agreement and satisfaction with our collective progress. Once again, this can be addressed during our weekly meetings.

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done? (You must grant your TA and partner access to systems you use to manage work)
   * **How do you prioritize tasks?**
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?

#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

We have scheduled regular weekly team meetings on Tuesdays, which can be conducted either offline on campus or online via Zoom. Additionally, there is a Discord group available for voice calls in case any members need to communicate for an urgent task. Every member is active and available for communication at least once every day if needed.

Regarding our partner, we also hold a weekly hour-long meeting with them every Thursday. Communication with our partner can also occur through email. During busier phases of our project, we may increase the frequency of our meetings to twice a week. Moreover, our partner will be added to Notion, our chosen task board and to-do list platform, as well as to our GitHub repository. This will allow them to track our progress, and they can also reach out to us via email if necessary.

**Communications:**
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels will be used? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process for communicating with your partner?
 
**Collaboration: (Share your responses to Q8 & Q9 from A1)**
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 * How will you address the issue if one person doesn't contribute or is not responsive?
