## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

-   When: November 20, 2023
-   Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.

2 important processes and actions we did that worked well were using the Kanban framework and doing standup during each meeting.

Using the Kanban framework helped our team to visualize organize each step of what needed to be done. We used Jira for our Kanban board and were able to assign each person their tasks, which helped with transparency and each member reach out to another member performing a similar task (to collaborate or get help).

Doing standup during each meeting solidified the Kanban framework further, where we explained what we did from our last meeting, what we plan to do after this meeting until the next, and if we needed help with any of our own work. This gave us more transparency with each other and a sense of accountability with finishing our tasks.

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

2 processes and decisions that did not work well for us were the Waterfall method and meeting together often per week.

We tried using the Waterfall method early on, but figured out quickly that it did not work for our team. Using the method was linear where our project is iterative. When planning the project out, we noticed there were a lot of changes and understandings we were not sure of, thus having to change our direction. This interfered with the Waterfall method so we changed to the Kanban framework which worked a lot better for our team!

Meeting together often per week as a team was not viable because of our conflicting schedules. We found that it was difficult to do and not worthwhile so we opted to meet once per week and a half and meet often within our sub-teams (frontend, backend, and database) instead. We figured we were more productive as we had our Kanken board and standup during meetings which held us accountable for our work. This allowed for everyone to work on their own time and regroup to see the work everyone finished during the time we did not meet.

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

Going forward, some process-related changes we may make is to have more retrospective meetings. After doing a retrospective meeting for this deliverable, we found it was nice and rewarding to go over our wins and what we need to do for our next deliverable in terms of improvements and planning. This was a nice way to wind down from the stress of the deliverable and mimicked a real-life workplace to keep iterating and doing better.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

We integrated the previously developed sub-repos by adding each sub-team's files to a branch we created. Since we were split by frontend, backend, and database, we had no conflicts in merging the sub-repos into one product, so our was to connect the sub-repos to each other in our product (frontend to backend and backend to database). This assignment was helpful because it showed us how to properly combine each sub-teams contributions to the main product safely and understand how to do so, which will be applicable in our career-life.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

-   How did you prepare your demo?
    To prepare our demo, we had our database ready with products and stores for our values to properly appear. As a team, we went over our demo in parts that each sub-team would share. After reviewing how our demo should be done, we decided that one person would launch the website on local host and screenshare it to our partner on Zoom. We made a checklist to follow step-by-step in what we wanted to show him and after each step we would make sure to give our partner time to process what he saw and if he had any feedback.

-   What did you manage to demo to your partner?
    To our partner, we managed to demo the login page, signup page with valid error checking upon registration, location services based on current location, profile information view, address searcher, searching for products using the search bar and the grid view, product information regarding grocery stores with stock, price logger that selects a store and the product to correct a current price, and a shopping list where users can add, check, and delete products.

-   Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
    Our partner did accept the features and said they were awesome! He congratulated us on our efforts and gave encouraged us to demo a lot in our career pathways. There were no change requests.

-   What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
    Our learnings through this process from the process perspective was a lot of teamwork and how to navigate through each other's work and connect it altogether (frontend to backend to database). From a product perspective, learning how to demo and encouraging ourselves to demo more often now and in our future careers.
