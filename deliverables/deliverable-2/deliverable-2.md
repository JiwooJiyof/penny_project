# Penny/Boolean Boos

## Summary Software
1. Summary of your software (you can reuse the same submission in D1 if it hasnâ€™t changed).

a. One paragraph for the problem & partner (if applicable)

b. One paragraph introducing any existing software/infrastructure (if applicable)

## Dividing the Project
1-4 paragraph(s) on how you decided to divide the project and why. Ideally, this will be accompanied by a software architecture diagram and how each component connects to the others.

We divided our project into three distinct subteams: frontend, backend, and data. This division was aimed at promoting an efficient development process by allowing each team to leverage their respective strengths. We allocated 2, 3, and 2 team members to the frontend, backend, and data teams, respectively, after several considerations. We recognized that the backend would require a substantial team to manage core functionalities and handle server-side processing, making it the largest team. For the frontend and user-interaction aspects, we assigned team members with experience in Dart and Flutter, the framework we are using. Also, the database team was crucial for data collection and processing. Each subteam plays a vital role in achieving our project goals, and this structure ensures a balanced workload. Each team has at least one member to review their work and progress. Furthermore, we are maintaining communication across teams to make sure that the project connects together seamlessly at the end.


The backend sub-team is responsible for all the backend features and functionalities that will help support Penny and allow the app to function as laid out in our user-stories. We decided to include this team as a part of our divided project, as the backend functionalities are imperative for Penny to work and function as intended.

(Frontend)

As stated earlier in the "Dividing the Project" section of our deliverable document, the backend team is mainly focused on the functionalities that happen behind the scenes. There are a variety of different actions a user can take in which the backend supports, such as selecting, searching, and sorting through grocery store items, searching and displaying stores with their items and respective prices, creating and managing a user account, and more. These functionalities stated are implemented in our deliverable 2, with further features such as location-based data and utilizing a user's current location being implemented later on. Our backend team is utilizing Python in order to bring these features to life, as well as using a JSON file containing hard-coded data that is used in our backend functions. This hard-coded data is only intended for the use of backend functionalities in this deliverable, and will be removed once the database is fully connected to the backend.
