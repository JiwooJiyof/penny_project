# Penny/Boolean Boos

## Summary Software
1. Summary of your software (you can reuse the same submission in D1 if it hasnâ€™t changed).

a. One paragraph for the problem & partner (if applicable)

b. One paragraph introducing any existing software/infrastructure (if applicable)

## Dividing the Project
1-4 paragraph(s) on how you decided to divide the project and why. Ideally, this will be accompanied by a software architecture diagram and how each component connects to the others.

We divided our project into three distinct subteams: frontend, backend, and data. This division was aimed at promoting an efficient development process by allowing each team to leverage their respective strengths. We allocated 2, 3, and 2 team members to the frontend, backend, and data teams, respectively, after several considerations. We recognized that the backend would require a substantial team to manage core functionalities and handle server-side processing, making it the largest team. For the frontend and user-interaction aspects, we assigned team members with experience in Dart and Flutter, the framework we are using. Also, the database team was crucial for data collection and processing. Each subteam plays a vital role in achieving our project goals, and this structure ensures a balanced workload. Each team has at least one member to review their work and progress. Furthermore, we are maintaining communication across teams to make sure that the project connects together seamlessly at the end.


The backend sub-team is responsible for all the backend features and functionalities that will help support Penny and allow the app to function as laid out in our user-stories. We decided to include this team as a part of our divided project, as the backend functionalities are imperative for Penny to work and function as intended.

## Sub-team Responsibilities
One paragraph for part(s) each sub-team is responsible for

(Frontend)

As stated earlier in the "Dividing the Project" section of our deliverable document, the backend team is mainly focused on the functionalities that happen behind the scenes. There are a variety of different actions a user can take in which the backend supports, such as selecting, searching, and sorting through grocery store items, searching and displaying stores with their items and respective prices, creating and managing a user account, and more. These functionalities stated are implemented in our deliverable 2, with further features such as location-based data and utilizing a user's current location being implemented later on. Our backend team is utilizing Python in order to bring these features to life, as well as using a JSON file containing hard-coded data that is used in our backend functions. This hard-coded data is only intended for the use of backend functionalities in this deliverable, and will be removed once the database is fully connected to the backend.

(Database)

The database team is responsible for populating the database with information
about the products and keep an up-to-date snapshot of the current prices
of the products in the stores. This will allow the backend team to accurately 
compare prices across different stores. Note the database already existed by
the time we entered the project but this team is also responsible for any changes
we will need to make to the database. We will use python as a library for most of the scraping
portion. We will use Beautiful soup and selenium to scrape the data and then use psycopg2 
to upload the data to the database.
The team will also eventually be responsible
for showing the backend team how to use and connect to the database. The biggest
responsibility of the team for now is figuring out how to scrape the data from
Metro and No Frills and uploading it to the database. This will eventually extend to other websites
but for now we are focusing on these two. This task ended up being harder than expected
due to the use of java-script and bot protection on both websites.
