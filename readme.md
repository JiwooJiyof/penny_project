> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical.

## Partner Intro

-   Kevin Lee, kevin@livekeen.com, Founder and Product Designer, primary point of contact for partner organization (Penny)
-   Penny is an early-stage startup organization founded by Kevin Lee in Toronto. The organization wishes to help consumers combat the challenging food prices in today's economy, with the consumer in mind, and build community around that aspect.

## Description about the project

-   Our application Penny will enable consumers to save on their groceries by taking unit pricing and comparing prices across multiple locations and stores. From an end-user's perspective, its value is that they are able to view products they wish to purchase and compare them in a variety of different stores for the best pricing. Users will be able to manage their grocery list and also section their list by stores, allowing them to pick and choose the best price for each list.
-   The problem we are trying to solve is the increasing food prices in the current economy downturn. They are a challenge for the normal consumer to face, but research shows that an average customer can save around 17% off their groceries with leveraged unit pricing. With Penny, customers can see the unit pricing for each product they wish to purchase and save as much as they can!

## Key Features

-   The key features in the applications are searching for grocery products, creating shopping lists, searching for stores/locations, product filtering, and a cost-to-distance ratio.
-   Key Features:

            -   Searching for grocery products: users can enter or select the grocery items they are looking to purchase where the app will display a list of stores with that product and its prices. Users can also sort and filter based off the pricing, which will be updated in real-time.
            Value: 5/5

            - Creating shopping lists: users can add items to their shopping list and can save, edit, or delete them. Users can also share their shopping list via email, messaging, or any other sharing option.
            Value: 5/5

            - Searching for stores/locations: users can input their location or turn on location services to detect the nearest grocery stores to them. From there, users can view the nearest grocery stores on the map and get directions, where each store will have basic information such as opening hours, contact information, and address.
            Value: 5/5

            - Product filtering: users can set dietary preferences in their profile or during searching, where the app will show only compatible products.
            Value: 3/5

            - Cost-to-distance ratio: users can see a cost-to-distance ratio for each store considering their shopping list price(s) and the distance to the store. They can sort and filter the stores based on the ratio and also get directions with different modes of transportation.
            Value: 3/5

## Instructions

-   Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
-   How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc.
-   Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
-   This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.

## Development requirements

-   What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
-   Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
-   You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.

## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​

-   Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
-   If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
-   Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
-   What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
-   Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Coding Standards and Guidelines

Keep this section brief, a maximum of 2-3 lines. You would want to read through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/) to get more context about what this section is for before attempting to answer.

-   These are 2 optional resources that you might want to go through: [article with High level explanation](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards-what-are-they-and-why-do-you-need-them/) and [this article with Detailed Explanation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
    ​

## Licenses

Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​

-   What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
-   What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
